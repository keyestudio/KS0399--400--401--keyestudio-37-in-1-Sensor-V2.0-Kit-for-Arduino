# KS0399 KS0400 KS0401 Keyestudio 37 in 1 Sensor Kit V2.0 for Arduino

# 1. Introduction

![](media/465df02619ee6c86341b7584b5d070b7.jpeg)

This is a 37 in 1 sensor learning kit for Arduino, rolled out by Keyestudio.

Inside this kit are digital/analog sensors, as well as some special modules such as ultrasonic module, joystick, relay module and acceleration modules, etc.

For each module, we provide a clear connection diagram and a sample code. Although you are a beginner, you can readily pick up how sensors work.

The sample codes for this sensor kit are based on Arduino. In addition, you have an alternative to apply this kit to other MCU development platform, such as 51, STM32, Raspberries Pi since the working principle is almost same.

Now, let’s start from the basic lessons.

**（13）keyestudio MEGA 2560 Board**

Keyestudio Mega 2560 R3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATMEGA2560-16AU , fully compatible with ARDUINO MEGA 2560 R3.

![](media/36f99ba889303256b23c173392186662.png)

It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, 1 ICSP header, and a reset button. The built-in ICSP port can burn the firmware for ATMEGA2560-16AU directly. This chip is burnt the firmware well before leaving the factory, therefore, we hardly use it. We can power on by USB wire, DC head and Vin GND pins. To facilitate wiring, a 0.5m USB wire is provided for you.

![](media/f1b8120d59d6deef70941ac0ebbe4fda.jpeg)

Specialized Functions of Some Pins:

1\. Serial Communication: D0 (RX0) and D1 (TX1); Serial 1: D19 (RX1) and D18 (TX1); Serial 2: D17 (RX2) and D16 (TX2); Serial 3: D15 (RX3) and D14 (TX3). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. Pins 0 and 1 are also connected to the corresponding pins of the CP2102 USB-to-TTL Serial chip.

2\. PWM Pins (Pulse-Width Modulation): D2 to D13, and D44 to D46. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function.

3\. External Interrupts: D2 (interrupt 0), D3 (interrupt 1), D18 (interrupt 5), D19 (interrupt 4), D20 (interrupt 3), and D21 (interrupt 2). These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low level, a rising or falling edge, or a change in level. See the attachInterrupt() function for details.

4\. SPI communication: D53 (SS), D52 (SCK), D51 (MOSI), D50 (MISO). These pins support SPI communication using theSPI library. The SPI pins are also broken out on the ICSP header, which is physically compatible with the Arduino Uno.

5\. IIC communication: D20 (SDA); D21 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the Wire library.

## Project 10: Digital Tilt Sensor

![](media/45a40bdcc098c1c4e0efb8246447173c.png)

**Introduction:**

Tilt Sensor is a simple digital tilt switch.

Simply plug it to our IO/Sensor shield or Arduino board, you can make interesting and interactive projects.

Tilt sensors (tilt ball switch) allow you to detect orientation or inclination. They are small, inexpensive, low-power and easy-to-use.

If used properly, they will not wear out. Their simplicity makes them popular for toys, gadgets and appliances.

![](media/8e773685510c53ba1b377fd8c9e14095.png)

Sometimes, they are referred to as "mercury switches", "tilt switches" or "rolling ball sensors" for obvious reasons.

They are usually made up of a cavity of some sort (cylindrical is popular, although not always) with a conductive free mass inside, such as a blob of mercury or rolling ball.

One end of the cavity has two conductive elements (poles).

When the sensor is oriented so that that end is downwards, the mass rolls onto the poles and shorts them, acting as a switch throw.

While not as precise or flexible as a full accelerometer, tilt switches can detect motion or orientation. Another benefit is that the big ones can switch power on their own. Accelerometer, on the other hand, output digital or analog voltage that must then be analyzed using extra circuitry.

## Project 12: Reed Switch

**Description:**

![](media/e580999515f6522eb603ea723bf62173.png)

Reed Switch is a special switch and a main component for reed relay and proximity switch. Reed switch is usually comprised of two soft magnetic materials and metal reed contacts which will disconnect itself when there is no magnetic.

In addition, some reed switches are also equipped with another reed acting as the third normally-closed contact. These reed contacts are encapsulated in a glass tube fulled of inert gases(such as nitrogen and helium) or in a vacuum glass tube.

The reeds encapsulated in the glass tube are placed in parallel with ends overlapped. Certain amount of space or mutual contact will be reserved to constitute the normally-open or normally-closed contacts of the switch.

Reed switch can be used as for count, limit or other purposes. For instance, a kind of bike-kilometer is constituted by sticking magnetic to the tire and mounting reed switch aside. You can also mount reed switch on the door for alarming purpose or as switches.

Reed switch has been widely applied in household appliances, cars, communication, industry, healthcare and security areas.

Furthermore, it can also be applied to other sensors and electric devices such as liquidometer, door magnet, reed relay, oil level sensor and proximity sensor(magnetic sensor). It can be used under high-risk environment.

## Project 26: Digital IR Transmitter

![](media/9fe876a8c857650226cbe2f8a9bead59.png)

**Introduction:**

IR Transmitter module is designed for IR communication which is widely used for operating the television device from a short line-of-sight distance. The remote control is usually contracted to remote.

Since infrared (IR) remote controls use light, they require line of sight to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, just like any other light source.

If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance, when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control.

Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it’s easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.

**Specification:**

-   Power Supply: 3-5V

-   Infrared center frequency: 850nm-940nm

-   Infrared emission angle: about 20 degrees
